# How to Automate Repeated Thigns in R

by [Jae Yeon Kim](https://jaeyk.github.io/)

File an [issue](https://github.com/dlab-berkeley/automating-workflows-in-R/issues) if you have problems, questions or suggestions.

## Overview

This workshop helps you to step up your R skills with functional programming. The `purrr` package provides easy-to-use tools to automate repeated things in your entire R workflow (e.g., wrangling, modeling, and visualization). The end result is cleaner, faster, more readable and extendable code. I highly recommend you to take this workshop (1) if you still write copy-and-paste code, (2) exclusively rely on for loops for automation, and (3) want to know about the joy and power of R functional programming.

## Learning objectives

1. How to use `purrr` to automate workflow in a cleaner, faster, and more extendable way

2. How to use `map2()` and `pmap()` to avoid writing nested loops.

3. How to use `map()` and `glue()` to automate creating multiple plots

4. How to use `reduce()` to automate joining multiple dataframes

5. How to use `slowly()` and `future_` to make automation process either slower or faster

6. How to use `safely()` and `possibly()` to make error handling easier
