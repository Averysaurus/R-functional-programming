# How to Automate Your Workflow in R

by [Jae Yeon Kim](https://jaeyk.github.io/)

File an [issue](https://github.com/dlab-berkeley/automating-workflows-in-R/issues) if you have problems, questions or suggestions.

## Overview

This workshop helps you to step up your R skills with functional programming. The `purrr` package provides easy-to-use tools to automate repeated things in your R workflow. The end result is cleaner, faster, more readable and extendable code. I highly recommend you to take this workshop (1) if you still write copy-and-paste code, (2) exclusively rely on for loops for automation, and (3) want to know more about the joy and power of R functional programming.

## Learning objectives

1. Write code 
2. Write functions for repeated parts
