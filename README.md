# How to Automate Your Workflow in R

by [Jae Yeon Kim](https://jaeyk.github.io/)

File an [issue](https://github.com/dlab-berkeley/automating-workflows-in-R/issues) if you have problems, questions or suggestions.

## Overview

This workshop helps you to step up your R skills with functional programming. The `purrr` package provides easy-to-use tools to automate repeated things in your R workflow. The end result is cleaner, faster, more readable and extendable code. I highly recommend you to take this workshop (1) if you still mostly copy and paste for your data work, (2) heavily rely on for loops for automation, and (3) are interested in writing more efficient R code.  

## Learning objectives 

## Prerequisites

## Setup 
1. Write code 
2. Write functions for repeated parts 
3. Automate iterations using `purrr`
4. Extensions
    1. Using multiple arguments 
    2. Making functions slower or faster 
    3. Catching errors 
    4. Adding conditional statements
