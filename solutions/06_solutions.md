# Make Error Handling Easier 

## Challenge 1 

Explain why we can't run `map(url_lists, read_html)`?

**Answer** In the example given, map will break because the fourth url is a bad url. The point of this problem is to get students thinking about the errors and use cases for the functions we write. If url_lists was a well formed list, then the code would run without error.
